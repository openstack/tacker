201:
  default: |
    Resource was created and is ready to use.
202:
  default: |
    Request was accepted for processing, but the processing has not been
    completed. A 'location' header is included in the response which contains
    a link to check the progress of the request.
204:

206:
  default: |
    Partial Content, The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the
    resource.

  default: |
    There are multiple choices for resources. The request has to be more
    specific to successfully retrieve one of these resources.
302:
  default: |
    The response is about a redirection hint. The header of the response
    usually contains a 'location' value where requesters can check to track
    the real location of the resource.
303:
  default: |
    The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource, as indicated
    by a URI in the Location header field, which is intended to provide an indirect
    response to the original request.

    Requested Range Not Satisfiable, A server SHOULD return a response with
    this status code if a request included a Range request-header field,
    and none of the range-specifier values in this field overlap the current
    extent of the selected resource, and the request did not include an
    If-Range request-header field.

  default: |
     The content type of the payload body is supported and the payload body of a
     request contains syntactically correct data (e.g. well-formed JSON) but the data
     cannot be processed (e.g. because it fails validation against a schema).
500:
  default: |
    Something went wrong inside the service. This should not happen usually.
    If it does happen, it means the server has experienced some serious
    problems.
503:
  default: |
    Service is not available. This is mostly caused by service configuration
    errors which prevents the service from successful start up.
