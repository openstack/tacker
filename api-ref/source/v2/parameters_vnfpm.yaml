authentication_auth_type:
  description: |
    Defines the types of Authentication/Authorization which
    the API consumer is willing to accept when receiving a
    notification.
    Permitted values:

    BASIC: In every HTTP request to the
    notification endpoint, use HTTP Basic
    authentication with the client credentials.

    OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS: In every HTTP request
    to the notification endpoint, use an OAuth 2.0 token,
    obtained using the client credentials grant type
    after authenticating using client identifier and
    client password towards the token endpoint.

    OAUTH2_CLIENT_CERT: In every HTTP request to
    the notification endpoint, use an OAuth 2.0 token,
    obtained using the client credentials grant type
    after mutually authenticating using client identifier
    and X.509 certificates towards the token endpoint.

    TLS_CERT: Every HTTP request to the
    notification endpoint is sent over a mutually
    authenticated TLS session, i.e. not only the
    server is authenticated, but also the client is
    authenticated during the TLS tunnel setup.
