authentication_auth_type:
  description: |
    Defines the types of Authentication/Authorization which
    the API consumer is willing to accept when receiving a
    notification.
    Permitted values:

    BASIC: In every HTTP request to the
    notification endpoint, use HTTP Basic
    authentication with the client credentials.

    OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS: In every
    HTTP request to the notification endpoint, use
    an OAuth 2.0 bearer token, obtained using the
    client credentials grant type.

    TLS_CERT: Every HTTP request to the
    notification endpoint is sent over a mutually
    authenticated TLS session, i.e. not only the
    server is authenticated, but also the client is
    authenticated during the TLS tunnel setup.
