# NOTE(bhagyashris): You may scratch your head as you see code that imports
# this module and then accesses attributes for objects such as Instance,
# etc, yet you do not see these attributes in here. Never fear, there is
# a little bit of magic. When objects are registered, an attribute is set
# on this module automatically, pointing to the newest/latest version of
# the object.

    # need to receive it via RPC.
