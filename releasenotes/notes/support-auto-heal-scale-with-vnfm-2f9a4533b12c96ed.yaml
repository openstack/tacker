    In Prometheus Plugin, two new interfaces are added to implement AutoHeal
    and AutoScale for VNF and CNF.
    As a VNFM, Tacker can decide whether to perform heal and scale operations
    through the received alarms sent by External Monitoring Tools, without
    NFVO.
    Added new user guide to help users understand the function.
