    Support the client function of the VNF LCM Coordination API in the
    Coordinate VNF script when performing the RollingUpdate with
    external management systems in the ChangeCurrentVNFPackage API.
    The sample script implements only the client function,
    not formal support for the VNF LCM Coordination API itself.
