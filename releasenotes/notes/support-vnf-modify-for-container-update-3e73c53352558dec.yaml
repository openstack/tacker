    Support configuration changes to VNF instances by adding
    ``modify_start`` and ``modify_end`` to MgmtDriver for the Modify VNF
    operation.
    We provide the sample of MgmtDriver which changes the configuration
    of ConfigMap and Secret in Kubernetes and changes the image parameters
    in the Pod and Deployment manifests.
