    Support error handling for LCM using MgmtDriver in V2 API. We added the
    ``user_script_err_handling_data`` variable to hold the data that needs
    to be preserved when the LCM fails.

    At the same time, we updated the MgmtDriver of the FaultNotification
    function to support error handling.
