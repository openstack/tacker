    From 2023.1 release, dependency on Mistral has been removed from Tacker
    entirely. This change removed: i) VIM monitoring; and ii) Mistral workflow
    in NS API. Due to the deletion of the VIM monitoring, the status field has
    been removed from the VIM table and VIM status in the response will be
    filled by a dummy value. This field will be completely removed in the next
    release
