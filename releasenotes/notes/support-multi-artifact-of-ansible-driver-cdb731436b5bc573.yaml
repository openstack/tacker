    The Ansible driver can only run specific script files.
    Due to multi artifact support of mgmt driver, it will be
    extended to specify script files to be executed in each life cycle.
    This will be achieved by implementing primary and dependencies
    keys defined by TOSCA, primary can define the primary script,
    dependencies can define a secondary script that will be referenced
    by the primary script.
