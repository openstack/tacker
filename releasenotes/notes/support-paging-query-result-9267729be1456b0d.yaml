    Support handling large query results according to ETSI NFV SOL013.
    This feature provides paged response regarding a query request of
    target APIs. In addition to that, fetching entire records at once
    becomes available.
issues:
  - Regarding handling large query results according to ETSI NFV SOL013,
    "vnfpkgm/v1/vnf_packages" API does not have the paging feature yet
    because of longer time to be implemented than the other APIs. Since
    there is less possibility to be paged in actual use case, the
    implementation will be done in the next release.
