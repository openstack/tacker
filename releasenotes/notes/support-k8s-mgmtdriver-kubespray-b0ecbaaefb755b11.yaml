    MgmtDriver function configures applications provided by VNF vendors.
    VNF vendors can customize configuration methods for applications via
    MgmtDriver. These customizations are specified by "interface" definition
    in ETSI NFV-SOL001 v2.6.1. We provide the sample of MgmtDriver and
    scripts which can deploy a Kubernetes cluster. It can use
    kubespray as Ansible playbooks to install Kubernetes cluster VNF,
    and also install and configure HAproxy load balancer for the Kubernetes
    cluster. We also provide a user guide to help users understand how to
    use this feature.

    Instantiate kubernetes cluster:
    The Kubernetes cluster can be instantiated with VNF Lifecycle
    Management Interface in ETSI NFV-SOL 003 v2.6.1.

    Scale kubernetes worker node:
    Scaling operations on the Worker-nodes for the VNF including
    Kubernetes cluster is supported with MgmtDriver.

    Heal kubernetes worker node:
    Healing operations on the Worker-nodes for the VNF including
    Kubernetes cluster is supported with MgmtDriver.
