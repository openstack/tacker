    This patch adds the ability to periodically synchronize resources
    in K8s VIM and Tacker DB.
    There is no interface on the K8s to notify Tacker when the auto-scale or
    auto-heal of a pod is running and the pod information is updated.
    This can lead to inconsistencies between the Pod information in Tacker
    database and the Pod information running on the actual K8s.
    This function periodically checks the pod information in the Tacker
    database and the pod information in the K8s, and updates the information
    in the Tacker database according to the K8s side if there is
    any inconsistency.
