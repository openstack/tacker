    Add the Performance Management Threshold interfaces and CLI to support
    AutoScale.
    The Performance Management Threshold interfaces are based on ETSI NFV-SOL
    003 v3.3.1, on which v2 VNF LCM API of Tacker is based.
    Add the Prometheus Plugin that has an interface between Tacker and the
    External Monitoring Tool.
    Prometheus Plugin supports data model conversion from Prometheus format
    data to SOL based PM Threshold schema, and vice versa.
