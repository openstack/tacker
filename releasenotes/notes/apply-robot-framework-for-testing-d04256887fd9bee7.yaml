    Support ETSI NFV compliant automated testing by using the Robot Framework
    and ETSI NFV-TST API test codes. This feature uses the Robot Framework
    which utilizes the ETSI NFV-TST API test codes to test tacker for ETSI
    NFV compliance in a Black Box testing level. This is an additional quality
    test measure to ensure that the added tacker features comply to the ETSI
    NFV standards.
issues:
  - |
    Regarding ETSI NFV compliant automated testing, some of the tests are
    failing due to bugs (1) Tacker Bug and (2) Issues in the ETSI NFV-TST API
    test codes.
    (1) Tacker Bug such as Bug-#1945387 was detected in this compliance test
    and the corresponding test is currently failing. Test will pass once the
    bug is fixed.
    (2) Issues in the ETSI NFV-TST API test codes such as schema and mock
    server location issues also caused some tests to fail. Tests will pass once
    the issues are resolved.
    Due to these existing failed items, this test is currently non-voting.
