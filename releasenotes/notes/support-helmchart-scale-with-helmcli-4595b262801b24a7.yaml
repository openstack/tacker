    Change scale operation of CNF that is instantiated with Helm chart to
    perform using Helm cli by specifying replica count parameters for each
    aspect_id at instantiation in advance.
    This change makes that upgrading the Helm values (e.g. nodeSelector or
    tolerations) directly in Kubernetes VIM after a scale operation from Tacker
    does not change the number of replicas.
