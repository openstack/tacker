    In the current implementation, when users invoke update operation of
    ConfigMaps and Secrets, all Pods are restarted even if they don't use
    those updated ConfigMaps and Secrets.

    Remove this limitation by filtering out resources that use
    Configmaps/Secrets and restarting those resources.
