    Functions to enable the use of Docker private registry images in a
    Kubernetes Cluster environment. We provide the sample of MgmtDriver
    which can deploy Docker private registry VNF for Kubernetes cluster
    before deploying Kubernetes cluster VNF, and deploy Kubernetes cluster
    VNF that can support both the Docker private registry created above
    and any others created outside of Tacker.

    Instantiate operation for Kubernetes cluster with MgmtDriver:
    MgmtDriver configures connections with Docker private registries on
    newly created all Master/Worker VMs.

    Scale-out operation for Kubernetes cluster Worker-nodes with MgmtDriver:
    MgmtDriver configures connections with Docker private registries on
    newly created Worker VMs.

    Heal operation for the entire Kubernetes cluster with MgmtDriver:
    MgmtDriver configures connections with Docker private registries on
    the created all Master/Worker VMs.

    Heal operation for a single node in Kubernetes cluster with MgmtDriver:
    MgmtDriver configures connections with Docker private registries on
    the created Master/Worker VM.
