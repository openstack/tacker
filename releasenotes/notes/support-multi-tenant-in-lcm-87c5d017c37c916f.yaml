    Support multi-tenant policy in VNF Lifecycle Management. The feature
    separates resources such as Virtualized Infrastructure Managers(VIMs),
    Virtualized Network Function Packages (VNF packages), and Virtualized
    Network Function Lifecycle Management Interface (VNF LCM) related to
    ETSI NFV-SOL based VNF management concerning tenants. Only allows VNF
    instantiation by VIM of the same tenant. This feature does not address
    the known issue of allowing non admin users to instantiate VNFs, it may
    be addressed in a future release.
issues:
  - A non admin user can not instantiate VNFs.
