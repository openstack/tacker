    MgmtDriver function configures applications provided by VNF vendors.
    VNF vendors can customize configuration methods for applications via
    MgmtDriver. These customizations are specified by "interface" definition
    in ETSI NFV-SOL001 v2.6.1. We provide the sample of MgmtDriver and
    scripts which can be used to deploy a Kubernetes cluster. The sample
    script for deploying Kubernetes cluster can be used in two cases.
    One is to deploy one master node with worker nodes. Under this case,
    it supports to scale worker node and heal worker node. The other is to
    deploy a high availability cluster, there are three(or more) master
    nodes with worker nodes. Under this case, it supports to scale worker
    node and to heal worker node and master node. In all the above cases,
    kubeadm is used for deploying Kubernetes in the sample script. We also
    provide a user guide to help users understand how to use this feature.

    Instantiate single master node kubernetes cluster:
    The Kubernetes cluster can be instantiated with VNF Lifecycle
    Management Interface in ETSI NFV-SOL 003 v2.6.1.

    Instantiate multi-master nodes kubernetes cluster:
    A Kubenrnetes cluster with a high availability (HA) configuration
    can be deployed.

    Scale kubernetes worker node:
    Scaling operations on the Worker-nodes for the VNF including
    Kubernetes cluster is supported with MgmtDriver.

    Heal kubernetes master and worker nodes:
    Healing operations on the Master-nodes and Worker-nodes for the
    VNF including Kubernetes cluster is supported with MgmtDriver.
