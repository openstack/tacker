    Add Container based VNF heal operation support with ETSI NFV-SOL002 and
    SOL003 v2.6.1 VNF Lifecycle Management. For "Heal VNFC with SOL002", users
    can heal Pod (mapped as VNFC) that is singleton or created using controller
    resources such as Kubernetes Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, and
    ReplicaSet. For "Heal VNF instance with SOL003", users can heal entire VNF
    instance by termination and instantiation of the VNF. And the VNFC resource
    information are stored and updated for the heal operation of the Pod.
