ETSI NFV-SOL CNF Change Current VNF Package
===========================================

This document describes how to change current VNF package for CNF in Tacker.

Overview
--------

The diagram below shows an overview of changing current VNF package.

1. Request Change Current VNF Package

   A user requests tacker-server to change current VNF package for VNF instance
   with tacker-client by requesting ``change current vnf package``.

2. Call Kubernetes API

   Upon receiving a request from tacker-client, tacker-server redirects it to
   tacker-conductor.  In tacker-conductor, the request is redirected again to
   an appropriate infra-driver (in this case Kubernetes infra-driver) according
   to the contents of VNF instance.  Then, Kubernetes infra-driver calls
   Kubernetes APIs.

3. Change the image of Container defined in the manifest file of Deployment

   Kubernetes Master update the image of Container defined in the manifest
   file of Deployment according to the API calls.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages should be installed:

* tacker
* python-tackerclient

At least one VNF instance with status of ``INSTANTIATED`` is required.
You can refer to :doc:`./etsi_containerized_vnf_usage_guide` for the
procedure to instantiate VNF.

You can also refer to :doc:`./vnf-package` for the operation of uploading
VNF package.

The sample packages for CNF can be obtained from the following links.

* `VNF Package for Common instantiate`_
* `VNF Package for Change Current VNF Package`_


Change Current VNF Package
--------------------------

As mentioned in Prerequisites, the VNF must be created
before performing change current VNF package.

You need to upload the VNF package you want to change to before
executing change current vnf package.

Details of CLI commands are described in
:doc:`../cli/cli-etsi-vnflcm`.

For changing current VNF package, you need to prepare a JSON-formatted
definition file before running command for changing the VNF package.

``sample_param_file_for_specified_resources.json:``

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "vnfdId": "c6595341-a5bb-8246-53c4-7aeb843d60c5",
    "additionalParams": {
      "upgrade_type": "RollingUpdate",
      "lcm-kubernetes-def-files": ["Files/new_kubernetes/new_deployment.yaml"],
      "vdu_params": [{
        "vdu_id": "VDU1"
      }]
    }
  }

``sample_param_file_without_specified_resources.json:``

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "vnfdId": "c6595341-a5bb-8246-53c4-7aeb843d60c5",
    "additionalParams": {
      "upgrade_type": "RollingUpdate",
    }
  }

.. note::
   Unlike Change Current Vnf Package for VNF,
   coordination scripts are not supported for CNF.
   Therefore, lcm-operation-coordinate files need not be
   specified by `additionalParams`.

You can set following parameter in additionalParams:

.. list-table:: additionalParams
  :widths: 15 10 30
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Attribute name
    - Cardinality
    - Parameter description
  * - upgrade_type
    - 1
    - Type of file update operation method. Specify Blue-Green or Rolling update.
  * - vdu_params
    - 1..N
    - VDU information of target VDU to update.
  * - > vdu_id
    - 1
    - VDU name of target VDU to update.

.. note:: ``sample_param_file_for_specified_resources.json`` contains
   all optional parameters.

   * ``vnfdId`` is the vnfd id of the new VNF package you uploaded.
   * ``lcm-kubernetes-def-files`` is only used in Kubernetes VIM, not
     OpenStack VIM. And you only need to set this parameter when you need to
     update the path of the manifest file of the deployment resource.
   * ``vdu_params`` is VDU information of target VDU to update.

.. note:: Currently, this operation only supports some functions of
   ``Change Current VNF Package``.

   * There are several ways to update deployment, but Yoga version Tacker only
     supports ``RollingUpdate`` type. You can set it via ``upgrade_type``
     param.

   * Currently only support update images of deployment.

   * Currently unsupported updates:

     * This API currently does not support increasing or decreasing the number
       of Pods according to the VNF package.
     * The add and delete operations of the entire deployment are not
       supported.
     * In the definition of ETSI, external networks (e.g. extVirtualLinks,
       extManagedVirtualLinks) can be modified. This API currently does not
       support the operations of modifying, adding, and deleting these
       networks.


How to Change Current VNF Package with specified resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update only specific kubernetes resources (e.g. deployment) by
specifying the file path of the kubernetes definition file in the
``lcm-kubernetes-def-files`` and vdu information in ``vdu_params``
of the ``change current VNF package`` request parameter file
(e.g. sample_param_file_for_specified_resources.json).

Execute Change Current VNF Package CLI command. After complete this change
operation you should check resource status by Kubernetes CLI commands.

1. check deployment's image information. This is to confirm that deployment's
image has changed before and after operation.

2. check the age of deployment and pods under this deployment. This is to
confirm that the deployment has not redeployed before and after operation,
and the pods under this deployment have redeployed.

3. check the status and name of pods under this deployment. This is to confirm
that the status of pods under this deployment are running, the name of pods
under this deployment has changed before and after operation.

How to Change Current VNF Package without specified resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can update all kubernetes deployment resources by not
specifying the file path of the kubernetes definition file in the
``lcm-kubernetes-def-files`` and vdu information in ``vdu_params``
of the ``change current VNF package`` request parameter file
(e.g. sample_param_file_without_specified_resources.json).

Execute Change Current VNF Package CLI command. After complete this change
operation you should check resource status by Kubernetes CLI commands.

1. check all deployments' image information. This is to confirm that
all deployments' images have changed before and after operation.

2. check the ages of deployments and pods under each deployment. This is to
confirm that the deployments have not redeployed before and after operation,
and the pods under each deployment have redeployed.

3. check the status and name of pods under this deployment. This is to confirm
that the status of pods under deployments are running, the names of pods
under deployments have changed before and after operation.
