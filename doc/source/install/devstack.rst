====================
Install via Devstack
====================

Overview
--------

Devstack based installation requires ``local.conf`` file.
This file contains different configuration options required for
installation.

Tacker provides some sample ``local.conf`` templates which can be
used for Devstack based Tacker installation.
You can find them in ``${TACKER_ROOT}/devstack`` directory in the
tacker repository.

Devstack supports installation from different code branches by
specifying branch name in your ``local.conf``.

* For latest version installation, use ``master`` branch.
* For specific release based installation, use corresponding branch name.
  For ex, to install ``wallaby`` release, use ``stable/wallaby``.

For installation, ``stack.sh`` script in Devstack should be run as a
non-root user with sudo enabled.
Add a separate user ``stack`` and granting relevant privileges is a
good way to install via Devstack [#f0]_.

Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that your system meets the following hardware requirements:

.. note::

  These are reference values to install ``Openstack and Kubernetes as VIM``
  which generally requires the most resources. In reality, more parameters
  affect required resources.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Criteria
     - Recommended
   * - CPU
     - 4 cores or more
   * - RAM
     - 16 GB or more
   * - Storage
     - 80 GB or more

.. note::

  We recommend that you run DevStack in a VM, rather than on your bare-metal
  server. If you have to run devstack on a bare-metal server, It is recommended
  to use a server that has at least two network interfaces [#f1]_.

Install
-------

Devstack installation script ``stack.sh`` expects ``local.conf``.

So the first step of installing tacker is to clone Devstack and prepare your
``local.conf``.

#. Download DevStack

   Get Devstack via git, with specific branch optionally if you prefer,
   and go down to the directory.

   .. code-block:: console

       $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack -b <branch-name>
       $ cd devstack

#. Enable tacker related Devstack plugins in ``local.conf`` file

   The ``local.conf`` can be created manually, or copied from Tacker
   repo [#f2]_. If copied, rename it as ``local.conf``.

   We have two choices for configuration basically:

   #. All-in-one mode

      All-in-one mode installs full Devstack environment including
      Tacker in one PC or Laptop.

      There are two examples for ``all-in-one`` mode:

      #. OpenStack as VIM.

         The example ``local.conf`` file for all-in-one mode with OpenStack
         is available at ``${TACKER_ROOT}/devstack/local.conf.example``.

         Refer below the contents of ``local.conf.example``:

         .. literalinclude:: ../../../devstack/local.conf.example
             :language: ini


      #. Openstack and Kubernetes as VIM.

         The difference between all-in-one mode with Kubernetes is
         to deploy kuryr-kubernetes and octavia.

         The example ``local.conf`` for all-in-one mode with Kubernetes is
         available at ``${TACKER_ROOT}/devstack/local.conf.kubernetes``

         Refer below the contents of ``local.conf.kubernetes``

         .. literalinclude:: ../../../devstack/local.conf.kubernetes
             :language: ini
             :emphasize-lines: 60-65

         .. note::

             The above local.conf.kubernetes does not work on CentOS8.
             Because docker-ce is not supported on CentOS8.

   #. Standalone mode

      Standalone mode installs only Tacker environment with some
      mandatory OpenStack services. Nova, Neutron or other essential
      components are not included in this mode.


      The example ``local.conf`` for standalone mode is available at
      ``${TACKER_ROOT}/devstack/local.conf.standalone``

      Refer below the contents of ``local.conf.standalone``

      .. literalinclude:: ../../../devstack/local.conf.standalone
          :language: ini

#. Execute installation script

   After saving the ``local.conf``, we can run ``stack.sh`` in the terminal
   to start installation.

   .. code-block:: console

       $ ./stack.sh
