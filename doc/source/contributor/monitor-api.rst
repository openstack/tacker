Tacker Monitoring Framework
============================

.. warning::
    Legacy Tacker features excluding VIM feature are deprecated
    and will be removed in the first major release after the Tacker server
    version 9.0.0 (2023.1 Antelope release).

This section will introduce tacker monitoring framework and describes the
various actions that a user can take when a specific event occurs.

Introduction
-------------

Tacker monitoring framework provides the NFV operators and VNF vendors to
write a pluggable driver that monitors the various status conditions of the
VNF entities it deploys and manages.

How to write a new monitor driver
----------------------------------

A monitor driver for tacker is a python module which contains a class that
inherits from
"tacker.vnfm.monitor_drivers.abstract_driver.VNFMonitorAbstractDriver". If the
driver depends/imports more than one module, then create a new python package
under tacker/vnfm/monitor_drivers folder. After this we have to mention our
driver path in setup.cfg file in root directory.

For example:
::

  tacker.tacker.monitor_drivers =
      ping = tacker.vnfm.monitor_drivers.ping.ping:VNFMonitorPing

Following methods need to be overridden in the new driver:

``def get_type(self)``
    This method must return the type of driver. ex: ping

``def get_name(self)``
    This method must return the symbolic name of the vnf monitor plugin.

``def get_description(self)``
    This method must return the description for the monitor driver.

``def monitor_get_config(self, plugin, context, vnf)``
    This method must return dictionary of configuration data for the monitor
    driver.

``def monitor_url(self, plugin, context, vnf)``
    This method must return the url of vnf to monitor.

``def monitor_call(self, vnf, kwargs)``
    This method is called cyclically each time a monitoring is
    triggered. **kwagrs** is a dict object given under **parameters** in
    the target VDU template. This method must either return boolean
    value 'True', if VNF is healthy. Otherwise it should return an event
    string like 'failure' or 'calls-capacity-reached' based on specific
    VNF health condition. More details on these event is given in below
    section.

Custom events
--------------
As mentioned in above section, if the return value of monitor_call method is
other than boolean value 'True', then we have to map those event to the
corresponding action as described below.

For example:

::

  VDU1:
    properties:
      ...
      monitoring_policy:
        name: ping
        actions:
          failure: respawn

In this example, we have an event called 'failure'. So whenever monitor_call
returns 'failure' tacker will respawn the VNF.


Actions
--------
The available actions that a monitor driver can call when a particular event
occurs.

#. respawn
    In case of OpenStack VIM, when any VDU monitoring fails, it will delete
    the entire VNF and create a new one.
#. vdu_autoheal
    In case of OpenStack VIM, when any VDU monitoring fails, it will delete
    only that specific VDU resource and create a new one alone with it's
    dependent resources like CP.
#. log
#. log_and_kill

How to write TOSCA template to monitor VNF entities
----------------------------------------------------

In the vdus section, you can specify the monitor details with
corresponding actions and parameters. The syntax for writing monitor
policy is as follows:

::

  vduN:
    properties:
      ...
      monitoring_policy:
        name: <monitoring-driver-name>:
        parameters:
          <param-name>: <param-value>
          ...
        actions:
          <event-name>: <action-name>


Example Template
----------------

::

  VDU1:
    properties:
      ...
      monitoring_policy:
        name: ping
        actions:
          failure: respawn

  VDU2:
    properties:
      ...
      monitoring_policy:
        name: http-ping
        parameters:
          port: 8080
        actions:
          failure: vdu_autoheal

  VDU3:
    properties:
      ...
      monitoring_policy:
        name: <your-driver-name>
        parameters:
          <param1>: <value1>
          <param2>: <value2>
        actions:
          <event1>: <action>
          <event2>: <action>
